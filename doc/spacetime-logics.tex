\section{Notation} In the following $\Gamma$, $\Sigma$ and $\Pi$ are names for finite multi-sets of formulas, $\Delta$ for sub-singleton of some formula, $A$, $B$ and $C$ for formulas, $p$ for propositional variables and $n$, $l$, $r$ and $k$ for natural numbers. We denote by $P$ the set of all propositional variables, and by $P(A)$ the set of those that occur in the formula $A$.

We will write $A$ for the singleton $\{A\}$ where ever it is inferable from the context.
``$,$'' is the multi-set union.
We will also write $A^1$ for $\{A\}$, write $A^{n+1}$ for $A^n, A$, write $\Gamma^n$ for $\{ A^n : A \in \Gamma \}$ and write $P(\Gamma)$ for $\bigcup_{A \in \Gamma} P(A)$

A sequent $\Gamma \Rightarrow \Delta$ is a binary relation between $\Gamma$, a multi-set of formulas, and $\Delta$, a sub-singleton of some formula

We will also write $\Box A$ for $\top \rightarrow A$.
