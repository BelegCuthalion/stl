\begin{thm}\label{cor:nc-riddance-i} Any sequent provable in $\igstl(S)$ is also provable in $\igstl^+(S)$ (for $S \subseteq \{L, R, Fa, Fu\}$).
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	Replace all instances of $cut$ with a cut-formula $A$, with a similar instance of $\nabla cut$ with cut-data $(A, 0, \{0\})$.
\end{proof}
