\begin{thm}[Lyndon's interpolation for $\stl$]\label{thm:stl-lyndon}
  {\color{red} Probably has a flaw!}
  The formula $C$ that was constructed as an interpolant for $\Delta'$ and $\Delta$ in Corollary \ref{cor:stl-dedint} has also this stronger property: $V^+(C) \subseteq V^+(\Delta') \cap V^+(\Delta)$ and $V^-(C) \subseteq V^-(\Delta') \cap V^-(\Delta)$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  It suffices to check that in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:stl-dedint}, this stronger property is preserved by our constructions of $C$, in the cases that are used to deduce Corollary \ref{cor:stl-dedint}, which are the cases where $\Gamma_2$ could be empty.
\end{proof}
