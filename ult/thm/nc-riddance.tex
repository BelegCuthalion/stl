\begin{thm}\label{cor:nc-riddance} Any sequent provable in $\gstl(S)$ is also provable in $\gstl^+(S)$ (for $S \subseteq \{L, R, Fa, Fu\}$).
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
	We can just replace any instance of $cut$ with a cut-formula $A$ with similar instance of $\nabla cut$ with cut-data $(A, \{0\})$.
\end{proof}
