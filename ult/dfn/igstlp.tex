\begin{dfn}[$\igstl^+$]\label{def:igstlp}
	Let $S \subseteq \{L, R, Fa, Fu\}$. Define $\igstl^+(S)$ to be the same systems defined as $\igstl(S)$, except that $cut$ is replaced by the generalization $\nabla cut$, as was defined in Definition \ref{def:gstlp}. \emph{Cut-data} and \emph{cut-burden} are also defined similarly. We will also assign a natural number, called \emph{Rank}, to any formula, rule instance and proof-tree in $\igstl^+(S)$, just as it was defined in Definition \ref{dfn:rank}.
