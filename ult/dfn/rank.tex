\begin{dfn}[Rank]\label{dfn:rank}
	Rank of a formula $A$ is defined as
	\[ \rho(A) = \begin{cases}
	1 & \quad ; A \in P \cup \{ \bot, \top \} \\
	\rho(B) & \quad ; A = \nabla B \\
	max(\rho(B), \rho(C)) + 1 & \quad ; A = B \circ C \quad (\circ \in \{ \land, \lor, \rightarrow \})
	\end{cases} \]
	Notice that $\nabla$ does not increase the rank of a formula.
	
	We also define rank for rule instances and proof-trees as follows. Rank of an instance of the $\nabla Cut$ rule with cut-data $(A, m, \{n_i\}_{i \leq l})$ is defined to be the rank of $A$. Rank of any other rule instance is $0$.
	For a proof tree $\mathcal{D}$, $\rho(\mathcal{D})$ is the maximum rank of all of its rule instances.
