\begin{dfn}[$\gstl^+$]\label{def:gstlp}
	Let $S \subseteq \{L, R, Fa, Fu\}$. We denote by $\gstl^+(S)$ the same systems defined as $\gstl(S)$, except that the $cut$ rule is replaced by the following generalization:
	\begin{prooftree}
		\AXC{$\Gamma \Rightarrow A$}
		\AXC{$\Sigma , \{\nabla^{n_i} A\}_{i \leq l} \Rightarrow \Delta$}
		\RightLabel{$\nabla cut$}
		\BIC{$\{\nabla^{n_i} \Gamma\}_{i \leq l} , \Sigma \Rightarrow \Delta$}
	\end{prooftree}
	where $\nabla^n$ means $\nabla$ applied $n$ times, $\{\nabla^{n_i} A\}_{i \leq l}$ means $\{\nabla^{n_0} A,\dotsb, \nabla^{n_l} A\}$ and $\{\nabla^{n_i} \Gamma\}_{i \leq l}$ means $\bigcup_{A \in \Gamma} \{\nabla^{n_i} A\}_{i \leq l}$ for some finite sequence of natural numbers $\{n_i\}_{i \leq l}$ of length $l+1$.
	We will refer to the set $\{\nabla^{n_i} A\}_{i \leq l}$ as the \emph{cut-burden} of this $cut$ instance. We will also call the pair $(A, \{n_i\}_{i \leq l})$ the \emph{cut-data} of such instance.
