\begin{dfn}\label{dfn:igstl}
	Define $\igstl$ over the language $\mathcal{L}_\supset$, to be the logic of sequent-style system as the logic of the sequent-style system defined by the same rules as $\istl$, as in Definition \ref{dfn:istl}, except the rule $L \supset$, which is replaced with the following rule.
