\section{Sequent calculi for the logics of spacetime}
In this section, will define the systems $\stl$ (defined as $\istl(N)$ in \cite{amir}) and $\gstl$, and show that these two systems are equivalent.

\input{dfn/stl}

Now, we will introduce $\gstl$, which we then show to be equivalent with $\stl$, and also cut-free. In the rest of this paper, we will use the short hand $\nabla^n A$ for $\nabla (\nabla^{n-1} A)$, for $n > 0$, where $\nabla^0 A$ is $A$.

\input{dfn/gstl}

To show the equivalnce of two systems, we will use the following lemmas. Notice that the proof-trees are constructible in $\stl(S)$ for $S \subseteq \{ L, R, Fa, Fu \}$.

\input{thm/l-nabla-dist-and}

\input{thm/l-nabla-box}

\input{thm/l-box-nabla}

\input{thm/l-nabla-dist-or}

\input{thm/l-nabla-n-dist-or}

\input{thm/l-nabla-bot}

\input{thm/l-nabla-n-bot}

\input{thm/l-nabla-dist-si}


In the rest of this paper, by the \emph{height of a proof-tree} $\mathcal{D}$, denoted by $h(\mathcal{D})$, we mean the number of rule instances in its longest branch.

The theorem below shows that $\stl$ (and its extensions) deduce exactly the same sequents as $\gstl$ (and its extensions).

\input{thm/stl-eq-gstl}


\subsection{Cut-elimination theorem}
Our proof of the admissibility of $cut$ in $\gstl(S)$ does not imply its admissibility in $\stl(S)$. But, as we will see, their equivalence (by theorem \ref{thm:stl-eq-gstl}) will allow us to use proof-theoretic methods for the cut-free system, and then translate its results back into a statement about the original system.

For technical reasons, we will work with a generalized form of the $cut$ rule, which nevertheless satisfies our goal here.

\input{dfn/gstlp}

\input{thm/nc-riddance}

Next, we need to define a measure for the complexity of the $\nabla cut$ rule. We will first define this measure for formulas, and then extend it to rule instances and proof-trees.

\input{dfn/rank}

The next lemma will help in handling of a case in the main theorem.

\input{thm/gstl-top-redundant}

The following theorem shows that we can imitate any instance of the cut rule in a proof-tree of lower rank.

\input{thm/gstl-cut-reduction}

The next theorem shows that the $cut$ rule is redundant.

\input{thm/gstl-cut-elim}

\subsection{Logic of spacetime with intuitionistic implication}
A conservative extension of $\stl$ is introduced in the next definition. This extension, which is called $\istl$ here, enrisches $\stl$ with intuitionistic implication. $\istl$ is conservative in the sense that adding intuitionistic implication will give no more power to the system in proving propositions in the original language of $\stl$.

\input{dfn/istl}

The following theorem shows that $\istl$ is just a conservative extension of $\stl$.

\input{thm/istl-ex-stl}

Now, we will introduce a counterpart for $\gstl$ with intuitionistic implication, which we call $\igstl$. In the following, we will also show that theorems \ref{thm:stl-eq-gstl}, \ref{thm:gstl-cut-reduction}, and \ref{thm:gstl-cut-elim} can be easily extended to also contain the cases for rules for intuitionistic implication, yielding the same results for $\istl$ and $\igstl$.

\input{dfn/igstl}

To show the equivalence between $\istl$ and $\igstl$, we need the following lemma.

\input{thm/l-nabla-dist-imp}

\input{thm/istl-eq-igstl}

We can also show that $cut$ is admissible in $\igstl$. To this end, we will first introduce a slightly altered version of $\igstl$ with the generalized $cut$ rule, just as we did for $\gstl$.

\input{dfn/igstlp}

\input{thm/nc-riddance-i}

\input{thm/igstl-top-redundant}

Next theorem is just a generalization of Theorem \ref{thm:gstl-cut-reduction} for $\igstl$.

\input{thm/igstl-cut-reduction}

Now we are ready to eliminate the $cut$ rule from $\igstl$, just as we did for $\gstl$.

\input{thm/igstl-cut-elim}

\subsection{Applications}
In this section, we will see some direct applications of our cut-elimination results. First, we will show that a generalization of Visser's rule is admissible in our system. To this aim, we would need the following lemmas.

Throughout this section, by $\Gamma \vdash A$ we mean there is a proof in $\stl(S)$ of $A$ with possible assumptions from $\Gamma$.

\input{thm/l-mp}

\input{thm/l-impl-elim}

\input{thm/l-conj-context}

\begin{rem}
	In the following, $\dotdiv$ is the truncated subtraction defined as $a \dotdiv b = max(a-b, 0)$.
\end{rem}

\input{thm/vissers-rule}

\begin{cor}[Disjuntion property]
	For all formulas $B$ and $C$, if $\vdash B \vee C$ then either $\vdash B$ or $\vdash C$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
	Just apply Theorem \ref{thm:visser} for $n = 0$.
\end{proof}

\section{Interpolation theorems}
{\color{red} Interpolation theorems do not hold if the extension contains $Fa$ or $Fu$, since they assume cut-ellimination results.}

Existence of \emph{interpolant} formulas was proved by W. Craig \cite{CraigA} for classical predicate logic. In this section, we prove \emph{Craig's interpolation} theorem for $\istl$ and all its extensions using a method similar to Maehara \cite{maehara1960interpolation}. We will also prove a weaker version called \emph{deductive interpolation} for any extension of $\stl$ containing $L$. For some formula $A$, by $V(A)$ we mean the set of all atomic variables of $A$ and for a multi-set of formulas $\Gamma$, by $V(\Gamma)$ we denote the set of all atomic variables occuring in some formula in $\Gamma$, i.e. $\bigcup_{A \in \Gamma} V(A)$.

\input{thm/istl-craig}

\input{thm/stl-deductive}

\subsection{Lyndon Interpolation}

We can easily check that our previous construction of interpolants for both $\istl$ and $\stl$ also satisfy Lyndon's definition \cite{Lyndon1959AnIT}. First, we need the following definition. The notion of the \emph{polarity} for an occurence of a subformula in some formula, simply tells if the subformula is in the antecedent of some implication for an even number of times or not.

\input{dfn/polarity}

So, for example, we have $p \in V^+((p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow r)$ and $p \in V^-((p \rightarrow q) \wedge r)$.
