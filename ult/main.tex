\section{Sequent calculi for the logics of spacetime}
In this section, will define the systems $\stl$ (defined as $\istl(N)$ in \cite{amir}) and $\gstl$, and show that these two systems are equivalent.

\input{dfn/stl}

Now, we will introduce $\gstl$, which we then show to be equivalent with $\stl$, and also cut-free.

\input{dfn/gstl}

To show the equivalnce of two systems, we will use the following lemmas. Notice that the proof-trees are constructible in $\stl(S)$ for $S \subseteq \{ L, R, Fa, Fu \}$.

\input{thm/l-nabla-dist-and}

\input{thm/l-nabla-box}

\input{thm/l-box-nabla}

\input{thm/l-nabla-dist-or}

\input{thm/l-nabla-n-dist-or}

\input{thm/l-nabla-bot}

\input{thm/l-nabla-n-bot}

\input{thm/l-nabla-dist-si}


In the rest of this paper, by the \emph{height of a proof-tree} $\mathcal{D}$, denoted by $h(\mathcal{D})$, we mean the number of rule instances in its longest branch.

The theorem below shows that $\stl$ (and its extensions) deduce exactly the same sequents as $\gstl$ (and its extensions).

\input{dia/stl}

\subsection{Cut-elimination theorem}
Our proof of the admissibility of $cut$ in $\gstl(S)$ does not imply its admissibility in $\stl(S)$. But, as we will see, their equivalence (by theorem \ref{thm:stl-eq-gstl}) will allow us to use proof-theoretic methods for the cut-free system, and then translate its results back into a statement about the original system.

For technical reasons, we will work with a generalized form of the $cut$ rule, which nevertheless satisfies our goal here.

\input{dfn/n-cut}

\input{thm/nc-riddance}

Next, we need to define a measure for the complexity of the $\nabla cut$ rule. We will first define this measure for formulas, and then extend it to rule instances and proof-trees.

\input{dfn/rank}

The next lemma will help in handling of a case in the main theorem.

\input{thm/gstl-top-redundant}

The following theorem shows that we can imitate any instance of the cut rule in a proof-tree of lower rank.

\input{thm/gstl-proof-reduction}

The next theorem shows that the $cut$ rule is redundant.

\input{thm/gstl-cut-elim}

\subsection{Logic of spacetime with intuitionistic implication}
A conservative extension of $\stl$ is introduced in the next definiotion. This extension, which is called $\istl$ here, enrisches $\stl$ with intuitionistic implication. $\istl$ is conservative in the sense that adding intuitionistic implication will give no more power to the system in proving propositions in the original language of $\stl$.
